## 🧠 Overview

This repository provides the implementation of a self-supervised deep learning framework for mapping **individualized multi-scale hierarchical brain functional networks (FNs)** from fMRI data. The method captures both spatially resolved FNs and their inter-scale hierarchical structure, enabling a deeper understanding of brain functional organization and its variability across individuals.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

We present a novel self-supervised deep learning framework that:
- Learns intrinsic representations of fMRI data in a low-dimensional latent space.
- Simultaneously computes multi-scale FNs and characterizes their hierarchical structure.
- Optimizes functional homogeneity across scales in an end-to-end learning manner.

The model is trained on fMRI scans from the Human Connectome Project and generalizes to external cohorts.

## 🚀 Key Contributions

- 📌 First framework to jointly estimate individualized multi-scale FNs and their inter-scale hierarchy.
- 🧬 End-to-end self-supervised learning using functional homogeneity as the optimization target.
- 🔁 Generalizable across datasets with robust performance on unseen individuals.

## 🧭 Applications

- 🧑‍🔬 Association with biological phenotypes such as sex, brain development, and brain health.
- 🧠 Insights into neurocognitive variability and hierarchical brain organization.
- 🧬 Potential for translational research in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.
