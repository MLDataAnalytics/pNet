Brain template supports both volume and surface data types
For volume data type, a Mask file and a high resolution T1/T2 overlay image are required
For surface data type, files for surface mesh shape including vertices and faces are required.
And mask files for two hemispheres are required to exclude vertices in medial wall or other low SNR regions.
Inflated surface mesh shape files are optional for different visualization purposes.
